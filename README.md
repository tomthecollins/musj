# musj

... is a collaborative iniative to curate/develop music representations and tools based around the JSON format.

An initial discussion on the MIR list mentioned:

* MusicXML -> JSON converter(s), which may maintain more or less of the input hierarchy

* Integration with [JAMS](https://github.com/marl/jams JAMS) for the storage and exploitation of annotations such as beats, chords, spectra, tags, etc.

* Playback (of audio) synced to one or more symbolic representations

* Specification of use cases, both for developers (e.g., synced playback as above) and end users (e.g., support of musicological research in an online space)

As such, the iniative is close to (and is in danger of reinventing) existing projects in the sphere of music computing. Contributors are welcome to list/link such projects on the wiki, so that interested parties can familiarize themselves with what's already out there.
